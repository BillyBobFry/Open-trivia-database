## Introduction
In this folder,we append a NLP(Natural Language Processing) module.
Since there is only one correct option in the list of options for each question,by this NLP module, the program can implement the function of automatically completing the remaining interference options.

### How to use

** First of all,you should have a python environment **

```
# Initialize the NLP environment
./init.sh
# When you are at this directory,you could input the follow command in the shell:
./auto_add_options.py
# Then you should input the path of the raw json file.such as:
# ./todo/arts_and_literature.json
# And now,you could enjoy the NLP program.
```
